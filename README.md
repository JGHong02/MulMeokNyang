## Proposal

Cats are known for their discerning palates and can be quite selective, particularly when it comes to wet food including water. This dietary preference can lead to dehydration and pose a significant threat to feline health. To address this issue, smart cat water dispensing systems aim to offer a solution through the identification and in-depth analysis of individual cats’ preferences and hydration needs.

Though there are many object or face recognition models, it is hard to find recognition model for individual animals such as cats. So, we will try to make a Artificial Intelligence(AI) model which recognizes individual cats with classifying cat breed. Assuming that one household own one or more than two cat breed, we can recognize individual cats. If there are two or more cats with the same breed, we are planning to detect them using simple algorithms like color distinguishing. There are requirements that need to be fulfilled. Firstly, the model should be able to detect the cat itself with image data. Secondly, the model should be able to recognize the cat’s breed. For image classification, Convolution Neural Network(CNN) seems to be the best choice therefore, we are going to make use of those AI model.
