## Proposal

The 'MulMeokNyang' service is designed to address the issue of cats' water intake, which is critical for preventing dehydration-related diseases. It utilizes AI models to recognize individual cats by their breed and distinctive colors. Users can register their cat's profile in the mobile app by uploading photos, and the AI extracts the breed and colors to store in the database. The water dispenser uses these data to identify individual cats through real-time video analysis. The service currently recognizes twelve cat breeds and relies on color differentiation for identification.

Limitations include the current breed recognition range and the lack of direct testing with water dispensers. The potential for development lies in enhancing AI accuracy and expanding the technology into other pet care areas. The market analysis indicates a growing demand for such services, promising profitability and market expansion opportunities.
