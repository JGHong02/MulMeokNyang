\begin{abstract}
Cats are known for their discerning palates and can be quite selective, particularly when it comes to wet food, especially if they haven't been exposed to a variety of flavors previously. This dietary preference, coupled with a reluctance to consume adequate water, can lead to dehydration and pose a significant threat to feline health. To address this issue, smart cat water dispensing systems aim to offer a solution through the identification and in-depth analysis of individual cats' unique preferences and hydration needs.

\section{INTRODUCTION}
\subsection{Motivation}


Cats tend to consume only the least amount of water, and due to this lack of drinking water, they often have health problems and have to go to the hospital regularly. Since animals are not applied by insurance, the burden of owners is considerable. In addition, in order to increase the amount of water consumed, the owners make them drink wet feed or force them to drink water through injections, but some cats suffer from allergic reactions to wet feed, and they show severe rejection to forced water intake by injection. \\
So we need a natural way to increase the amount of water consumed. Also, the number of households raising companion animals is increasing these days due to the increase in single or two-person households. \\

Therefore, we will proceed this project so that households with cats can manage the amount of water consumed by cat through smart cat water supply machine and mobile applications. \\

\subsection{Problem Statement}
Though there are some exceptions, most cats are particularly susceptible to becoming dehydrated as they abhor drinking water like other animals do. Smart cat water supply machine is a project aiming to recognize individual cats and analyze their water consumption data in order to make sure they are consuming appropriate amounts of food and water to avoid dehydration. We envision Smart cat water supply machines to allow clients, especially with more than two or more cats, to have access to cats' water consumption data easily and notify them if they may be in a threatening condition. \\

In the existing pet water supply system, only one animal per water supply system could be managed because there was no individual identification function in case of raising multiple cats and dogs in one household. With this in mind, our team will recognize the faces of multiple pets to enable differentiated negative number management for each individual. \\

Our goal is to provide clients with an application that can monitor their cats’ water consumption data individually and hopefully give clients information on cats’ health conditions. Identification will be done by embedding a camera on the feeder product and capturing cats’ faces to analyze their facial features through Machine Learning. This solution will be able to help both clients and cats themselves by being able to monitor their water intake easily and providing them with necessary information regarding cats' health condition. \\

\subsection{Research on any related software}

The AI cat feeding product landscape is indeed populated with various existing solutions, reflecting the strong interest of pet owners in this field. However, it's important to note that the majority of these solutions fall into two categories: not AI, commercially-driven products, and non-open source projects. It was either too simple to be called Artificial Intelligence or AI part was very confidential.
\newline

\subsubsection*{VaraemPet's Welli Smart Hydration Care}

In response to the central proposition concerning the daily water intake recommendation for humans, this innovative AI-driven pet hydration monitoring system seeks to address the vital question of how to ensure our pets' proper hydration. This system offers comprehensive hydration monitoring, enabling pet owners to precisely gauge their pets' hydration levels in comparison to recommended averages. It meticulously records and evaluates crucial data, including food intake, water consumption, and weight, all consolidated within a comprehensive health record. Furthermore, it provides real-time notifications via the Baraem app, keeping pet owners updated each time their pets drink and offering valuable insights into their hydration patterns. To facilitate a deeper understanding of their pet's hydration trends, the app displays detailed daily, weekly, and monthly hydration graphs, along with comparisons against peer averages. Additional features encompass monitoring remaining water levels and issuing timely cleaning notifications. The system's adjustable height feature caters to pets of various sizes, ensuring a comfortable drinking experience. Moreover, it follows a standard hydration formula based on the pet's weight, recommending a daily water intake of (Weight x 50 ml). It's important to note that the product's limitation lies in its inability to provide individual identification for multi-pet households, which means it cannot differentiate or tailor services for each pet separately.

\section{Development Environment}
\subsection{Choice of software development platform}
We are using Windows and MacOS environment and for cli we are likely to use bash terminal or powershell most of the time. Other tools like vscode or jupyter notebook will be based used as well. Windows might not be the best choice for software development environment but it is considered one of the good option and as we don't have any linux machine, we had no choice.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|p{1.4cm}|p{6.2cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Tool and language} & \textbf{\textit{Reason}}\\
\hline
Typescript & Typescript is an open-source programming language that is a super-set of JavaScript. By specifying the static type, type errors can be prevented, high code readability, and errors can be checked during compilation. It is also a class-based object-oriented programming language that can support inheritance, encapsulation, and generator. Since all the team members are familiar with JavaScript, and Typescript is a complementary language to JavaScript, we chose to learn it through this opportunity 
\\ \hline
React Native & React Native can develop platform applications and is partially compatible native. It was judged that developing Android and IOS applications in native languages was less efficient, and the accessibility of developing React Native was high due to the knowledge of React. In addition, it is a framework that is widely used in the field, so we chose it as the front-end language.
\\ \hline
Expo & Expo is a React Native cross platform for development. It was judged that Xcode was not available because we do not have a Mac OS device, and it was inefficient because it was not suitable for the project size to develop using both Android studio and Xcode. With Expo, IOS applications can be developed in Windows as well, and real-time tests can be made with mobile devices held through the Expo application. In addition, it was used because the initial setting was simple and there were many modules needed to develop the Expo SDK.
\\ \hline

\end{center}
\end{table}
\newpage

\begin{table}[!htbp]\normalsize
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|p{1.8cm}|p{5.8cm}|}
\hline
Node.js & Node.js is commonly used by back-end development beginners because it can quickly process data with an asynchronous event-based architecture and provides most of what is needed in package manager. Most of the team members does not have back-end development experience and have knowledge of JavaScript, so we decide to use Node.js. 
\\ \hline
MySQL & We need a database to store the user information, user's cat information, list of co-manager, and water consumption data. MySQL is an open-source relational database system language, we decide to use because all team members have used it in the "Database System" class.
\\ \hline
Amazon Web Services(AWS) & To back up and manage databases by building and hosting cloud-based servers, we intend to use Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) \st{and Amazon SageMaker to manage machine learning services. With SageMaker, data scientists and developers can quickly and easily build and train machine learning models, and then directly deploy them into a production-ready hosted environment.} We can get a 12-month Free Tier also a reason for choice.
\\ \hline
Python 3.11 & Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Because Python is simple to use and it can be used in Machine Learning development, its popularity in AI and ML development is very high. We will be using libraries like matplotlib for visualization, tensorflow/pytorch for image classification, scikit-learn for data analysis, and all the rest of the necessary libraries like pandas or numpy etc.
\\ \hline
Jupyter Notebook & Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It supports various programming languages, including but not limited to Python, R, and Julia. Jupyter Notebooks are widely used in data science, machine learning, scientific research, and education.

\begin{itemize}
\item[a.]{Visual Studio Code}
   \newline
   Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is an open-source IDE and can be used in various environments such as Windows, macOS, and Linux. In addition to code editing, it supports various development tasks such as debugging, version management, and terminal access, also there are many extension plug-ins that can increase development productivity with plug-ins such as Prettiers. We chose this IDE because the OS of laptops used by team members is different, also it would be easy for everyone to use the same IDE for smooth cooperative working.
    \\ \end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item[b.]{Git hub}
   \newline
   A version management system based on Git that allows multiple developers to work simultaneously, track changes, and avoid conflicts. The remote storage provided enables collaboration online, and facilitates communication between team members, code review, and issue management. We hope to use GitHub to prevent version problems during collaboration and to check and develop each other's code.
    \\ \end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item[c.]{\emph{Database Management System}}
   \newline
   A database management system is essential to manage the information of the user, the user's cats, and cats’ water consumption data. To easily and securely store the information associated with it, the database needs to be designed and built.
    \\ \end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item[d.]{\emph{Figma}}
   \newline
   Figma is a web-based UI/UX design tool. It supports many designers and developers to collaborate in real-time, and does not require installation. It is easy to build and manage reusable components, making it possible to maintain a consistent design pattern, which also contributes to increasing developer productivity. In addition, it is available for free and is not difficult to use, so we chose it as a software design tool.
    \\ \end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item[e.]{\emph{Open CV}}
   \newline
   This is a library of programming functions mainly for real-time computer vision. We found other alternatives like YOLOv8. However, it is unclear whether it could be used or not due to my limitation on knowledge and time. For now, we are looking to use built-in Haar Cascade alorithm for object detection.
    \\ \end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item[e.]{\emph{Flask}}
   \newline
   Flask micro web framework written in Python. This framework will be used to communicate between front-end and back-end(AI) locally.
    \\ \end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item[e.]{\emph{PyTorch}}
   \newline
    PyTorch is a machine learning framework derived from the Torch library, designed for tasks like computer vision and natural language processing. Initially created by Meta AI and currently under the Linux Foundation umbrella, PyTorch is freely available as open-source software distributed under the modified BSD license. In this context, our objective involves utilizing the pre-trained ResNet50 model within PyTorch and refining it through training, with a specific focus on fine-tuning for the classification of cat breeds.
    \\ \end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item[e.]{\emph{scikit-learn}}

\subsection{Database Structure}
The list below is the tables and schemes for MulMeokNyang database. When creating tables that need to be created in advance and cat's drink measurement management spaces, there are tables that need to be created dynamically.\\

Tables that need to be generated in advance include a user
table to store data for membership users, a session table
to store data related to the automatic login function, a message auth table to store message authentication code temporarily and a management space table to store the id of all created spaces and the main and co-managers. \\

Tables that need to be dynamically generated include a management\_space table to store basic data related to management space, a cat\_in\_management\_space table to store basic data for cats to manage in management space, and a cat\_hydration\_statistics table to store data related to the drinking volume of a specific cat. Tables that need to be created dynamically are created together sequentially, and the table name includes the values of the spaceId and catId variables. This allows you to dynamically create and associate tables by management space and individual cat.\\

\subsection{AI}
\subsubsection{Cat Detection}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[] \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{img/AI/1.png}
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
    \subitem It runs through the footage of cat drinking water using OpenCV. If cat is present, pretrained YOLOv8 model will detect and crop the cat from frame of the footage. YOLOv8 offers save\_text function which will make an txt file containing class(cat=15), annotation, and id information of cropped cats. Rest of the Python script will turn the txt file into Pandas DataFrame and will be used to store captured cats' information. \\
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Cat Color Detection}
\begin{itemize}
    \subitem The Python script employs computer vision and machine learning techniques to analyze images of cats, extracting dominant color information. The Ultralytics YOLO model is first used for object detection and segmentation, isolating cat-related objects in the images. The script then applies K-Means clustering to identify five dominant colors in each segmented image, calculating their frequencies. The dominant color and its associated name are determined, and the color information is integrated into a DataFrame representing cat-related attributes. Additionally, the CIELAB color space is utilized to enhance color representation. The script incorporates functions to handle color similarity, conversion between different color representations, and updates the DataFrame with the extracted color information. Finally, the script saves the processed DataFrame, including dominant color and CIELAB color, back to the original CSV file that contains the image labels and identifiers. \\
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Cat Breed Detection}
\begin{itemize}
    \subitem The Python script utilizes a pretrained(custom) ResNet-50 model for image classification on a dataset containing images of cats. The model, loaded with weights, is fine-tuned on the specific task of identifying cat breeds using transfer learning. A custom model head is added to the ResNet-50 architecture, consisting of fully connected layers. The trained model is then used to predict the breed of cats in a set of images, and the results are integrated into a DataFrame representing cat-related attributes. The script incorporates image preprocessing steps, including resizing and normalization, before feeding them into the model. The predicted breed labels are then appended to the DataFrame, and the updated DataFrame is saved back to the original CSV file. The script is designed to handle multiple cat images and categorize them based on their predicted breeds, utilizing the ResNet-50 model's classification capabilities. \\

\section{ARCHITECTURE DESIGN \& IMPLEMENTATION}
\subsection{Overall architecture}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[] \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{img/Screen/architecture.png}
\end{itemize}
The overall architecture of our system is designed with several interconnected modules. Users interact with our application, and any input or information provided through the app is transmitted to the backend server via a REST API. The backend is a infrastructure that leverages MySQL for database management and AWS S3 for scalable storage solutions.\\

The user-facing application serves as the front end, allowing individuals to easily interact with the system. Behind the scenes, the REST API acts as a communication bridge between the application and the backend server. This ensures a standardized and secure method for transmitting data. On the hardware side, we have the CatFeeder module, which also communicates with the backend server through REST API.\\

MySQL serves as the relational database management system, providing a structured and organized storage solution for our data. AWS S3, on the other hand, handles object storage, offering scalability and durability for larger datasets and file storage needs.

\subsection{BackEnd Module}
\subsubsection{Node.js - Serverless}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Purpose : The project, being relatively small in terms of required APIs and involving two backend developers with limited project development experience, led to many considerations regarding server management and modularization. During this collaboration, the developers discovered the AWS Lambda serverless service, realizing that deploying APIs using this service allows for API-specific management without the need for separate server maintenance. Given the need to quickly develop APIs and manage servers, using serverless to modularize APIs and deploy them to the cloud was deemed suitable for the project scale.
        \item Functionality : Deployment and management of individual API endpoints.
        \item Location of Source Code

\section{DISCUSSIONS}
\subsection{Ann Jukyung}
Reflecting on this project experience, where my main responsibilities included backend API development and preparing presentation materials, I encountered several challenges, particularly in the realm of backend development. Being my first foray into this area, everything from understanding and implementing libraries and modules to the nuances of code syntax was a steep learning curve.\\

The initial phase of the project was the most daunting. I had to quickly familiarize myself with various backend technologies, understand how different APIs interact, and grasp the essentials of server management. The challenge was not just in learning new concepts but in applying them practically. I often found myself struggling with debugging and optimizing the code, which was both time-consuming and, at times, frustrating. \\

One of the most significant challenges was ensuring efficient communication between the backend and frontend parts of our application. Aligning the data formats, handling requests and responses, and ensuring data security were areas where I had to invest considerable effort and research. \\

Moreover, preparing presentation materials while simultaneously handling the technical aspects was a task that required effective time management. Distilling complex backend processes into understandable segments for the presentation demanded a different skill set. I had to balance between being technically accurate and making the content accessible to non-technical stakeholders. \\

Despite these challenges, the experience was immensely educational. I learned not just about technical aspects but also about resilience, the importance of thorough research, and the value of patience and persistence. Moving forward, I intend to apply the knowledge and collaborative experience gained from this project to numerous future endeavors. The practical insights I've acquired, particularly in backend development and team dynamics, will be invaluable assets in my ongoing professional journey. I aim to continuously integrate and leverage these learnings in upcoming projects, enhancing my technical proficiency and teamwork skills incrementally over time. \\

In this team project, I was responsible for the front-end development using React Native. Although I had prior experience with several development projects, my skills were lacking. I had only worked on small personal projects multiple times. However, through this project, I managed to implement the basic structure of a commercial application. From user registration and login to our service's unique feature of managing hydration spaces, I successfully implemented various functionalities. It feels satisfying to produce a proper outcome for the first time.\\

Especially, creating a mobile app using React Native felt like a significant growth point for me. Previously, React didn't resonate with me, so I mainly developed using vanilla JavaScript. However, inspired by this project, I decided to delve into React Native, a choice favored by many front-end developers. At the beginning of the semester, I spent a month studying theory by purchasing a book and practicing code examples. From mid-October, I began the front-end development and completed it within a month and a half.\\

My primary focus in this development was on modularization. I modularized functions and components that seemed likely to be reused later. Initially, although the functionality was limited, I felt concerned as the folder structure became complex and the number of files increased. However, as I progressed, I realized the importance of modularization. For instance, our application had several input fields. I created a custom component called 'inputContainer', allowing the creation of appropriate input fields on various screens by passing different property values based on the screen. It took me an entire day just to implement this component. Consequently, even though it seemed like I hadn't achieved much that day, creating intricate components resulted in quickly completing screens that required input fields in just about an hour and a half. Also, our application had similar screens for either registering or editing information. Initially, I struggled to figure out an efficient structure for these screens. However, I achieved modularization by passing the 'method' property to identify whether it's a registration or editing screen. Thus, I could implement identical UI/UX designs but handle modifications differently by implementing different callback functions for registration and editing buttons. As I progressed, although the content to be developed became more challenging, the consistent focus on modularization allowed me to progress steadily without delay.\\

However, there were some regrets. This was my first substantial project using React Native, and time was limited. Therefore, when faced with challenging concepts, I opted for an easier route instead of delving deeper. Regrettably, I abandoned two things. Firstly, Redux - I used the Context API to manage global states instead of Redux, which is more suitable for complex global state management. Since Redux was the most challenging part for me, I was unsure if I could handle it within the given time frame. However, due to the considerable number of global variables in our application, the code efficiency was compromised. Secondly, the Drawer component - I couldn't comprehend how to perform nested navigation using the Stack Navigator and Drawer Navigator together. Consequently, I created the Drawer as a custom component, and to navigate using the Drawer, I added screens directly to the Stack Navigator. Although I chose to abandon these due to time constraints, I'm planning to overcome these shortcomings during this winter break by working on new toy-projects.\\

Collaborating with the backend wasn't without challenges. Our team had two backend developers who were completely new to backend development. I took the initiative to create backend development guidelines explaining which APIs to implement and the logic behind them. Development started in November, and assuming the APIs were implemented, I had to write code to call these APIs and bind data. Therefore, it was challenging to verify the accuracy of the code I had written. If even in real-world scenarios, frontend development sometimes initiates before API development, one should become familiar with verifying using mock data for the initial validation.\\

In my role using Node.js with the Express framework, I took charge of developing backend APIs and overseeing code reviews, subsequently deploying them serverlessly on AWS. The initial foray into API development and AWS services proved challenging, marked by trial and error. Notably, grappling with reading environmental variables in the code and configuring AWS S3 permissions posed difficulties. Branch merges were hindered by version disparities in modules, prompting a shift towards individual API distributions to mitigate collisions, albeit not entirely successfully.\\ 

Navigating through package.json, I gleaned insights into the critical role of version management. Despite encountering challenges, tapping into AWS official documentation and collaborative problem-solving within the team proved instrumental. This project provided a holistic view of software development, encompassing service planning through to distribution, and underscored the significance of teamwork in resolving issues.\\

In my role overseeing AI development, I feel sorry for our team members, recognizing the challenges we faced throughout the process. The realization of even minor mistakes, including typos, took me several days. Delving into the intricacies of pre-trained models was a time-consuming endeavor, requiring a substantial investment to comprehend their workings effectively, espeically YOLO models from ultralytics.\\

The training phase, on the other hand, proved comparatively straightforward. Thanks to the professor's guidance, the official PyTorch documentation offered comprehensive codes that facilitated a step-by-step understanding of the training process. Troubleshooting became manageable through resources like Stack Overflow, enabling us to address errors as they arose while awaiting the computer's autonomous execution.\\

Yet, the most formidable aspects of the development journey were encountered during implementation, feature engineering, and file organization. Navigating the complexities of connecting the AI components seamlessly with both the front-end and back-end systems presented additional challenges. Deploying the model online initially aimed at utilizing AWS Sagemaker, but due to a time constraint resulting from extensive focus on AI training and development, I couldn't allocate time to master AWS intricacies. This led to a minor financial setback of \$4.4, as I inadvertently left the Sagemaker instance active.\\

Despite this setback, we successfully pivoted to a local deployment using Flask. This experience highlighted the multifaceted nature of AI development, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach that encompasses not only training but also the integration and deployment phases.\\

As we approached the project deadline, a significant realization dawned upon us—we found ourselves increasingly reliant on ChatGPT, even evolving into adept prompt engineers within a short span. This reliance underscored the versatility and efficiency of utilizing language models like ChatGPT in the development process.\\

Furthermore, reflecting on the project experience, I recognized the need to explore AI development with Tensorflow in the future. This shift would facilitate seamless integration of AI models with JavaScript format, particularly beneficial for mobile applications in the front-end. Additionally, I acknowledged the importance of diversifying the dataset, suggesting that in future AI endeavors, I should experiment with a broader range of cat breeds, deliberately ignoring class imbalances to observe the impact on accuracy.\\

The project journey also underscored the significance of soft skills in the realm of software development. Understanding software life cycles, effective communication methods, the importance of documentation, individual responsibilities, and proficient project management all emerged as crucial components. As software developers, it became evident that meticulous consideration of these factors is imperative to navigate through the development process smoothly. Effective communication, in particular, plays a pivotal role in preventing miscommunication and misunderstandings.\\

A key takeaway from this experience is the necessity of collaborative efforts in group development projects. Solo endeavors can lead to inefficiencies and misunderstandings. Instead, fostering open communication, understanding everyone's requirements, and delineating individual tasks contribute to a cohesive and successful development process. It serves as a reminder that the synergy of skills and ideas within a team enhances the overall quality of the project.\\

Frankly, initially, the concept of teaching a computer to analyze images and accurately predict their content, particularly in terms of categorization, struck me as a rather audacious idea. At the time, it seemed almost implausible. Little did I realize that I was somewhat lagging behind the rapid advancements in the modern tech world, and what I perceived as an audacious concept was merely the tip of the iceberg.\\

Through this project, I've come to understand that the AI landscape is continuously evolving, with advancements far beyond what I initially perceived as impossible. The project not only broadened my technical expertise but also shed light on the importance of soft skills in navigating the complexities of the AI industry. It underscored the dynamic nature of technology and the ongoing need for individuals to adapt and stay abreast of the latest developments.\\

In essence, this project has been a catalyst for my personal growth, providing insights into the limitless possibilities within the AI industry. It has ignited a curiosity to delve deeper into the unexplored realms of artificial intelligence, recognizing that there is so much more to be discovered and leveraged for the betterment of the world.\\
